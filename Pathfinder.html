                    This is a project developed by Samuel Ko as an introduction to basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The project highlights basic webpage design concepts, </br>
                    simple animation, user interaction, and an understanding of pathfinding algorithms both algorithmically and visually.

                    Clicking one of the "add" buttons will allow you to click and drag across the grid to modify the nodes of the grid. </br></br>
                    A start node is a point or points where the algorithm will start its search </br></br>
                    An end node is a point or points where the algorithm will end its search </br></br>
                    The algorithm will search for the shortest path from a start to an end node, multiple start and end nodes can be created </br></br>
                    A wall node is an impassable obstacle that the algorithm will have to move around </br></br>
                    A weight node adds to the cost of moving over it, normal nodes have a cost of 1 </br></br>
                    When the algorithm is finished a shortest, lowest cost path will be highlighted </br></br>
                    If no path is possible, a path will not be highlighted </br></br>
